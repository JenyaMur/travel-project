          What You Should Know Before Travelling to Albania
        </h1>
        <p>
          Albania is one of the most interesting countries in Europe, and one of
          the friendliest – perhaps in part because it’s so small, with a
          population of just 2.8 million. It is also a top destination for
          foodies, with affordable fine dining and delicious local dishes such
          as fëgesë stew to try. Be pleasantly surprised by the world-class
          beaches of the Riviera, or find your inner adventurer by hiring a car
          and driving into the mountains. Here’s what to know before you go.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">Albanians are incredibly friendly</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best things about travelling to the Land of the Eagles is
          that wherever you go, from the capital city to the Riviera, from the
          mountains to the historical towns, you will be welcomed by the locals.
          Albania is one of the friendliest countries you’ll ever visit. So
          don’t be afraid to ask for directions or other information – there
          will always be someone who will help you find what you’re looking for,
          be it accommodation, a place to eat or transport advice. Many
          Albanians speak English, and tourism is developing within the country
          and is welcomed as a key part of the country’s economy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">The beaches along the Riviera are gorgeous</h2>
        <p>
          There is a good reason why most tourists visiting Albania come to its
          beaches: the Albanian Riviera has some of the finest stretches of
          coast in Europe. These pebbly and sandy shores line crystal waters
          that could stand toe-to-toe in a beauty contest with the beaches of
          Italy, Greece or Croatia. The best beaches on the Riviera are
          Drymades, with clear water, live music and beach bars, and Ksamil,
          which also has clear-blue water and is part of Butrint National Park.
          However, you will find sublime stretches of sand all along the coast.
          Palasa Beach, surrounded by rocky cliffs and green hills, is also a
          great place to relax, as is Dhermi beach, which has a party vibe.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">Albania isn’t just about fantastic beaches</h2>
        <p>
          Although the Albanian Riviera and its stunning beaches are great
          reasons to visit, the country has so much more to offer. Mountains,
          including the Albanian Alps and the Sharr and Pindus ranges, run along
          the length of the country. Archaeological sites include prehistoric
          mounds, as well as ancient Greek and Roman temples and forts, and
          medieval bathhouses. The country is also rich with lakes and rivers,
          forests and ancient towns that will take your breath away. Albanian
          holidays should always be organised with plenty of time built in for
          exploring the country’s many natural and historical wonders.

        <h2 class="text-muted">Travelling in Albania is an adventure</h2>
        <p>
          A trip to Albania is a real adventure. If you don’t like travelling
          off the beaten path, change your plans and go elsewhere. If you rent a
          car here, you’ll understand. People tend to cross the road when they
          want, drivers do whatever they want and animals love to relax and
          sleep in the middle of the streets. Needless to say, driving in the
          country can be quite a challenge. The other option, if you don’t want
          to rent a car, is to travel through the country by bus. Albanian
          travel can be a challenge – there are no official bus timetables, so
          be prepared to be patient and ask locals where the stops are. We
          strongly suggest renting a car, because buses will not necessarily get
          you where you want to go.
