          Why Everyone Must Visit Bali, Indonesia in Their Lifetime
        </h1>
        <p>
          Indonesia, which is made up of thousands of islands in between the
          Indian and Pacific oceans, is the world’s biggest island country. And,
          even though the population swells to over 263 million people, the
          country is home to an immense wilderness, chock-full of biodiversity.
          Situated along the equator, on the Pacific Ring of Fire, this tropical
          nation experiences more than its fair share of earthquakes and
          volcanic eruptions. Nature and culture draw millions of visitors each
          year and the province of Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination.
          Read on to discover the top seven reasons to visit Bali.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">Go for Sun, Sand, and Sea</h2>
        <p>
          Visiting the Indonesian archipelago awards travelers with stunning
          beaches as far as the eye can see and Bali has some of the most
          gorgeous shorelines in the world. From the calm easy-surfing waters at
          Seminyak Beach to Padang Padang Beach, highlighted in Julia Roberts’
          movie, Eat, Pray, Love, to the black volcanic sands of Keramas Beach
          to the popular-with-tourists Legian and Kuta beaches, you’ll have no
          problem finding a warm-water oasis to match your desires and
          interests.
        </p>

            <img
              src="/images/bali11.jpeg"
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              alt="bali"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="text-muted">Unearth Your Bliss</h2>
        <p>
          There is no bad time to visit tropical Bali as the weather is
          consistently warm and humid year-round, with an average daily
          temperature of around 82 degrees-Fahrenheit. You’ll run into either
          the wet or dry season, both offering different experiences. Many
          tourists prefer to visit in the dry season between May and September,
          when the humidity levels tend to be at their lowest. However, visiting
          during January and March may afford travelers better deals on hotels
          and tour packages.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">
          Engage Your Senses: The Island of a Thousand Temples
        </h2>
        <p>
          You’ll notice Balinese Hindu temples, or Pura, around the larger
          community areas as well as within family compounds, from the highlands
          to the coast. While on a bicycle tour around Ubud, in and out of
          family-filled villages, your guide will likely stop at many
          temples—big and miniature—to leave offerings of cigarettes, flowers,
          candy, and incense. Tanah Lot, Ulun Danu, Gunung Lebah, and Goa Lawah
          are worth visiting while in Bali. Adhere to the traditional dress and
          bring a sarong, tied at the waist.

          Learn About the Dynamic Balinese Art and Culture
        </h2>
        <p>
          See a Balinese dance performance where stories are expressed through
          vibrant full-body movement that utilizes the hands, face, and feet.
          Listen to live Balinese music. Visit a local festival or celebration
          like the Balinese New Year, Bali Spirit Festival, Ubud Food Festival,
          Bali Art Festival, Bali Kite Festival, or the village temple festival
          called Odalan. Consider purchasing wood sculptures, hand stamped and
          dyed Batik prints, handmade silver jewelry, weaved goods, or an
          intricate painting. The Balinese are masters of many crafts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">
          Hike an Active Volcano with a Reputable Guide
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mount Batur, or Gunung Batur, located west of Mount Agung, is an
          active volcano on the island, which experiences eruptions every few
          years. Active hikers can summit the 5,633-foot peak in just two hours.
          Hiking early to reach the top at sunrise is a popular activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide that hiking to the top is not for you, consider visiting
          a local village where you can still see Mount Batur. The village of
          Penelokan in Kintamani offers visitors wonderful sightseeing spots for
          photography.
        </p>
        <div class="row mb-4">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="/images/bali6.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="bali" />

            <img src="/images/bali7.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="bali" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Pay attention to safety and environmental precautions and hike with a
          reputable guide. If there’s a chance of activity or unsafe conditions,
          postpone your hike and enjoy the mountain from a safer distance.
          Follow the local rules and regulations. Also, be sure to check natural
          disaster travel advisories prior to your visit.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">Get Your Coffee Fix</h2>
        <p>
          Indonesia, with its warm-weather mountainous location along the
          equator, produces and exports a large amount of coffee. Coffee
          production in Bali occurs in the highland territory of Kintamani,
          between two active volcanoes, and is mainly grown by small-scale local
          farmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be cautious of what is touted as “The most expensive coffee in the
          world”: luwak coffee. Brewed from partially digested coffee cherries
          that have traveled through the digestive track of the civet, a
          cat-like animal, this labor-intensive coffee is dense and has a grainy
          taste. There is no guarantee that the coffee is produced by wild
          civets and, in fact, many are caged.
        </p>
        <p>
          All over Bali, on coffee plantations in the highlands and in coffee
          shops around the beach communities, you can get a quality cup of
          locally-sourced coffee.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">See Rice Terraces</h2>
        <p>
          Rice is a staple in Bali and a major part of the Balinese culture. The
          terraced rice paddies, surrounded by lush vegetation, are a sight to
          see throughout the countryside, especially at first light. The
          irrigation system, shared within the communities to support the health
          of the fields, has been happening for centuries and the ingenuity of
          it all is quite remarkable. Tegallalang, Jatiluwih, and Belimbing Rice
          Terraces are popular and worth a look-see. Be prepared to give a
          donation and wear shoes that can get wet and muddy. Amateur and
          professional photographers alike will find plenty of green-filled
          landscapes to capture while visiting.
