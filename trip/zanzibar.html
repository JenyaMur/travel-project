        <h1 class="text-muted">10 Reasons Why You Should Visit Zanzibar</h1>
        <p>
          Zanzibar is the perfect destination if you’re looking for pocket
          friendly exotic holidays. It comes at no surprise why many compare it
          to the likes of Maldives and Seychelles. Miles of powder-white sandy
          beaches and crystal clear turquoise waters are the number one reason
          why you should visit Zanzibar. Past the exotic beaches, this island is
          steeped in history and has wonderful cuisine. When you combine all
          that with the great people you meet everywhere in Zanzibar, then you
          have all you could ask from an ideal holiday destination.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">STONE TOWN</h2>
        <p>
          The only way to truly experience Stone Town is by allowing yourself to
          get lost. This UNESCO Heritage Site may feel somewhat overwhelming at
          first. Past that first impression, start exploring its winding narrow
          alleyways and you will quickly warm up to it. Expect to have all of
          your senses heightened as you begin to stroll through its streets. The
          smell of the street food including chapattis, samosas and roasting
          corn amongst many others, will be all too inviting. You will find
          stalls selling fruits and all kinds of aromatic spices. On each turn,
          you will come across locals playing Bao (a traditional board game)
          while watching passers by.
        </p>
        <div class="row mb-4">
          <div class="col text-center">
            <img
              src="/images/zanzibar5.webp"
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              alt="zanzibar"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Part of Stone Town’s charm is also the mixture of Arabic, Indian and
          African culture. That heritage is naturally reflected on the
          architecture. Ancient buildings are dotted across the town,
          distinguished by unique carved wooden doors. Each door in Zanzibar’s
          historic buildings has a unique story to tell. It is said that the
          doors reflect the social status and religion of the family who lives
          in the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          TIP: The historic part of Stone Town is busy but very intriguing. My
          suggestion is that you book a walking tour to explore Stone Town. An
          experienced guide will be able to share his knowledge about the
          history of the island. As well as, share his insight about the local’s
          lifestyle.

        <h2 class="text-muted">PRISON ISLAND</h2>
        <p>
          Prison island is one of those places that you may find it somewhat too
          touristy, but I would recommend that you don’t skip a visit. The
          island got its name back in 1890 when a prison was built, where slaves
          would be imprisoned. However, upon the completion of the construction,
          the plan was never put into action. Instead, it was used as a place to
          quarantine people who were diagnosed with yellow fever. The island is
          also home to giant tortoises which were brought to Zanzibar years ago
          from the Seychelles. The oldest one is known to be 192 years old!

        <h2 class="text-muted">MNEMBA ISLAND & BLUE SAFARI</h2>
        <p>
          Exotic islands and watersports go hand in hand and Zanzibar is a
          wonderful destination to try water activities. Locals and expats who
          live in Zanzibar will be quick to tell you that Mnemba island is the
          ideal place to go for diving. On the island there is only one luxury
          hotel, meaning that access to non-guests is not allowed. Do not let
          that discourage you because the real fun is actually underwater, in
          the reef surrounding the island. It is a very popular destination not
          only for diving but also snorkeling. I had the best time ever,
          swimming in the most extraordinary turquoise water and watching the
          colourful reef and the myriad of fishes. I will savor this memory
          forever!
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">THE LOCALS</h2>
        <p>
          I am always very curious about the culture and the people of a country
          that I’m visiting. This time was no different and naturally, I was
          very much looking forward to making new friends. As soon as we landed
          in Zanzibar “Jambo” (the Swahili word for “hello”) was the first word
          we heard. That same way we were greeted by the locals, wherever we
          would go in Zanzibar. It was a natural impulse to be a bit cautious
          and distant at first. We were thinking that most probably that
          approach was simply an attempt to sell us something. Quite honestly,
          most of the time it was. However, being friendly comes naturally to
          Zanzibari people and it is an important part of the local culture. As
          soon as we let our guard down, we realised that even if we were not
          interested in buying something, they would still engage in
          conversation and just wanted to ask how our day was. That led to us
          meeting some of the nicest and friendliest people in Zanzibar.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">ZANZIBARI CUISINE</h2>
        <p>
          The Zanzibari cuisine is a mixture of many different foreign
          influences, including Indian; African, Arabian and Portuguese. A
          perfect blend of flavorsome chapatis and curries, pilau, fresh fish
          and seafood to name a few. Don’t hesitate to try new flavors, as long
          as you are cautious where you eat. The safest places to try the local
          cuisine is at your hotel, the Stone Town Night Market (it is best if
          you avoid fish and seafood here) or at a recommended restaurant. A
          dishe that you simply must try before you leave the island, is the
          urojo soup. A coconut curry broth filled with toppings. In terms of
          toppings expect anything from egg to meat skewers and from falafels to
          peppers.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-muted">IS ZANZIBAR SAFE FOR TOURISTS?</h2>
        <p>
          I know what you’re thinking and why you may or may not be looking for
          more reasons to visit Zanzibar. Is Zanzibar a safe country to visit?
          The answer is yes, Zanzibar is one of the safest African destinations.
          Tourism plays an important role in the country’s income. That means
          that the locals welcome anyone visiting and take their safety
          seriously. With that being said, it is always advised that you use
          common sense. Avoid things such as walking alone at night in isolated
          areas and leaving your valuables unattended at the beach.

        <h2 class="text-muted">GOOD TO KNOW BEFORE TRAVELLING TO ZANZIBAR</h2>
        <p>
          Malaria is common in Zanzibar, be sure to plan ahead and take
          anti-malaria medication. We used Malarone as this particular brand was
          recommended by most pharmacists we asked. We were advised to start
          taking one pill 2 days before landing in Tanzania, during our stay and
          continue the medication for 7 days after we left the country. Also,
          bug spray is a MUST, preferably a strong one with 50% DEET. One thing
          that was unclear for us when we were planning our trip was whether we
          needed a yellow fever vaccination or not. We flew out from Malta via
          Istanbul and we were not required to have the Yellow Fever
          vaccination. Also, we were not asked for proof of vaccination by the
          airport control upon entering Tanzania. The vaccination is however
          mandatory if you are coming from countries with a very high percentage
          of Yellow Fever cases, such as Kenya.
